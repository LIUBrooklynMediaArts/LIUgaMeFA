APPLYING TO THE PROGRAM

Note: applications are now open for the Fall 2017 cohort! - read on for more details and information on how to apply.

The LIU Game and App Design and Development MFA is a full-time, two-year 48-credit cohort-based studio graduate program in the Media Arts department of LIU Brooklyn, situated in the heart of the greatest city in the world.

Before applying, we encourage your to read the program details post here: [LINK TO PROGRAM DETAILS POST]. It clarifies many of the terms in the above summary and answers many of the questions you may not even know you had about the program structure, its focus (mobile VR & AR), the expected degree of commitment, the specific jobs that the program is designed to prepare you for, and more. 

This is particularly important since the program's unusually tight focus means it will almost certainly not be the right fit for everyone interested in game or app design - on the other hand, you may find that it feels like a much better fit than the many more loosely structured programs that are available.

It would also be a great idea to research the world you would be entering by enrolling in and completing the program, for example by exploring the exhibitor list of the VRDC (Virtual Reality Developers Conference), trying out as many VR / AR experiences as you can get your hands on (particularly mobile ones - Google Cardboard is an inexpensive option), downloading and starting to explore the free and powerful Unreal Engine that you'd exclusively use to make your games and apps while in our program, attending some of the VR / AR Meetups that may be available in your area, and following new industry developments through sites like UploadVR and Augmented.Reality.News.

If you have any additional questions, please reach out to me (the program director) at ilya DOT zarembsky AT gmail DOT com. I'll be glad to hear from you.
