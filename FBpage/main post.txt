HELLO, AND WELCOME to the online HQ of the LIU Brooklyn Game and App Design and Development MFA program!

The LIU gaMeFA (for short) is a new full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based graduate studio program in the Media Arts department of Long Island University's downtown Brooklyn campus.

Many game design MFA programs are relatively freeform and unfocused, producing graduates who often struggle in an industry that heavily rewards specialization.

The LIU gaMeFA, by contrast, has a tight focus (mobile VR and AR) and a highly structured curriculum. We have designed the program this way with one main goal in mind: to make sure you graduate with skills deep and marketable enough to get you a good job.

For more info about the program structure, the curriculum, what jobs the program can or definitely will not prepare you for, and more, see [link to program structure post]

For instructions on how to apply, see this post: http://bit.ly/2rBZdrc. We are currently accepting applications for Fall 2017!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch through the Send Email button on this page. I will be happy to talk with you over email and/or Skype.

Cheers,
Ilya Zarembsky
Director, LIU gaMeFA
