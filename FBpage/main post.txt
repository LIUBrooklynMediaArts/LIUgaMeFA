Hello, and welcome to the Facebook page of the LIU Brooklyn Game and App Design and Development MFA program!

The LIU gaMeFA (for short) is a new full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based graduate studio program in the Media Arts department at LIU Brooklyn, a private university located in the vibrant heart of the greatest city in the world (Manhattan is alright too, we guess).

The program uses a tight focus on mobile VR and AR platforms to make sure students graduate with highly marketable, well-developed skills.

For more details about the program structure and curriculum, see [link to program structure post]

For instructions on how to apply, see [link to application instructions post]

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch through the Send Email button on this page. I will be happy to talk with you over email and/or Skype.

Cheers,
Ilya Zarembsky
Director, LIU gaMeFA
