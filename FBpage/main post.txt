Hello, and welcome to the Facebook page of the LIU Brooklyn Game and App Design and Development MFA program!

We are a new full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based graduate studio program in the Media Arts department at LIU Brooklyn, a private university located in the vibrant heart of the greatest city in the world (Manhattan is alright too, we guess).

Our goal is to help students get jobs designing and making games and apps - well-paying, full-time jobs that let them exercise significant creative agency and offer meaningful opportunities for advancement.

In pursuit of this goal, the program has a tight focus on developing for rapidly growing mobile VR and AR platforms like Samsung VR using the industry-standard Unreal Engine.

The focus is there because that's where a great deal of the money will be, alongside as much creative opportunity as anywhere else.

The focus is this tight to make sure that students graduate with a depth of expertise that will make them immediately employable, while giving them a strong foundation for further professional and creative growth in a range of directions most relevant to their personal interests.
