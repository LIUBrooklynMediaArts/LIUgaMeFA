Hello, and welcome to the online HQ of the LIU Brooklyn Game and App Design and Development MFA program!

The LIU gaMeFA (for short) is a new full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based graduate studio program in the Media Arts department at LIU Brooklyn, a private university located in the vibrant heart of the greatest city in the world (Manhattan is alright too, we guess).

Many game design MFA programs are relatively loose, unfocused, and conceptual, leaving underprepared graduates to fend for themselves in an industry that heavily rewards specialization and technical competence.

The LIU gaMeFA, by contrast, considers making you employable its primary goal and responsibility. It is designed from the ground up to make sure that all students graduate with highly marketable and relevant technical and collaborative skills.

For more info about the program structure, the curriculum, what jobs the program can or definitely will not prepare you for, and more, see [link to program structure post]

For instructions on how to apply, see [link to application instructions post]. We are currently accepting applications for Fall 2017!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch through the Send Email button on this page. I will be happy to talk with you over email and/or Skype.

Cheers,
Ilya Zarembsky
Director, LIU gaMeFA
