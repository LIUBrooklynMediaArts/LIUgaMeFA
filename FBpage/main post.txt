HELLO, AND WELCOME to the online HQ of the LIU Brooklyn Game and App Design and Development MFA program!

The LIU gaMeFA (the e stands for entrepreneurship) is a new full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based graduate studio program in the Media Arts department of Long Island University's downtown Brooklyn campus.

Many game design MFA programs are relatively freeform and unfocused. The LIU gaMeFA, by contrast, has a tight focus (mobile VR and AR) and a highly structured curriculum. 

We have designed the program this way with one main goal in mind: to make sure you graduate with skills deep and marketable enough to get you a good job.

For details about the program structure, the coursework, what jobs we will and will not prepare you for, living in New York, and more, see this post: 

For instructions on how to apply, see this post: http://bit.ly/2rBZdrc. We are currently accepting applications for Fall 2017!

If you have any questions, click that Send Email button :) I will be happy to talk with you over email and/or Skype.

Cheers,
Ilya Zarembsky
Director, LIU gaMeFA
