LIU Game and App Design and Development MFA (LIU gaMeFA for short): Program structure, focus, limitations, goals, and expectations



The LIU gaMeFA is a full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based studio graduate program focused on - you guessed it - game and app design and development.


The LIU Game and App Design and Development MFA (LIU gaMeFA for short) is a full-time, two-year 48-credit cohort-based studio graduate program that will prepare you for a meaningful job in mobile VR / AR game or app development.


I AM PRIMARILY/ONLY INTERESTED IN WORKING IN "AAA"/CONSOLE GAME DEVELOPMENT. WOULD THIS PROGRAM BE A GOOD FIT FOR ME?

If you have done your research and are sure that's what you want, no. 

Make sure you have done that research, though. Use resources like Gamasutra.com and Reddit AMAs to learn as much as you can about the day to day realities of working in AAA. One thing you will likely discover is that almost none of even the senior positions at companies like Naughty Dog, Rockstar, or Blizzard afford the kind of broad creative control over the nature and shape of large projects that often attracts people to the >idea< of working in AAA. 

By contrast, teams in the mobile game and app development industries, while often still sizeable, tend to be smaller, often giving even relatively junior employees an opportunity to have significant creative input.

Think about whether you would prefer to be a small cog in a huge wheel (AAA), or a medium cog in a medium wheel (mobile)*. If you decide on the former, forget this program and look at programs like DigiPen, SCAD, USC, and The Guildhall at SMU instead. If after some research and reflection the latter seems more attractive, give us a closer look.

* Obviously there are breakout exceptions, but the reality is that these are the experiences of the vast majority of the talented, skilled, hard-working and ambitious people on both sides of the fence. Throwing caution to the wind and making your choice planning and intending to be one of those superstar exceptions is very sexy, of course - but before you do that, make sure you understand with visceral power and clarity that the reason such a choice is so sexy is that it is extremely dangerous and foolish; i.e. the risk of emotionally and financially catastrophic disappointment is exceptionally high.

I AM PRIMARILY/ONLY INTERESTED IN BEING AN INDIE/DIY GAME DEVELOPER, AND/OR WORKING AT THE INTERSECTION OF GAMES AND ART. WOULD THIS PROGRAM BE A GOOD FIT FOR ME?

As with AAA, no.

If you want to be an indie/diy developer, don't go to grad school - at least not unless you can get a (near-)full scholarship. Instead, simply start making games using the many great free tools aggregated at sites like PixelProspector.com, use game jams like Ludum Dare and the Global Game Jam for networking, constraints, structure, and accountability, enter design competitions like the ones regularly administered by the Games For Change festival, apply to incubators, attend game-related events in person if you live in a city with a game scene (in NY, check out Babycastles and the NYU Game Center, to name just two), put your games up for sale on sites like itch.io to teach yourself about marketing, follow your favorite game devs on Twitter, submit your games to festivals like IndieCade and IGF and try to attend them if you can, and most of all, make sure to have a day job. If you insist on going anyway, consider the NYU Game Center.

If you want to work at the intersection of games and art - perhaps creating large-scale interactive museum installations, or leading workshops at organizations like EYEBEAM - grad school makes more sense, as it can give you the cultural capital and connections that are so valuable in that space. But in our program, all of your studio projects would be team-based, and there's at least as much focus on technical as on conceptual work. Unless that appeals to you, and/or you are specifically strongly interested in the mobile VR / AR space, look instead at programs like UCLA,  Parsons, or, again, NYU.

I AM INTERESTED IN TEACHING AT THE COLLEGE / GRAD SCHOOL LEVEL. WOULD THIS PROGRAM BE A GOOD FIT FOR ME?

It might be. Our program awards the Master of Fine Arts degree. The MFA is what is known as a terminal degree - the most advanced degree of its kind - and as such, it will give you the credential you need to teach game design and/or development at the undergraduate or graduate level.

However, the LIU gaMeFA program curriculum does not focus on developing teaching skills, and opportunities to practice teaching during your time here would be limited at best, as there is currently no undergraduate game design program at LIU Brooklyn.

Also, note that no MFA degree, regardless of where you got it, would prepare or credential you to teach game studies / theory (as opposed to design and development). If your interests lie in that direction, consider the many game-related Ph.D. programs instead.  




OK, SO THEN....WHO IS THIS PROGRAM A GOOD FIT FOR, ANYWAY?




What do you mean by "design"?
In the context of the program, "design" 

What do you mean by "development"?

Does the program have a specific focus?

Given this focus, who is the program most appropriate for?

I am interested in "AAA"/console game development. Is this program a good fit for me? 

What does it mean exactly that the program is "cohort-based"? 

What do you mean exactly when you say it's a "full-time" program?

What does it mean exactly that it's a "two-year" program?

When you say "48-credit" what does that mean? How do credits translate to workload?

Does the program have a focus?


More specifically, the program focuses on game and app design and development for mobile VR and AR platforms like the Samsung VR and the upcoming Magic Leap, using the popular and powerful Unreal Engine as the central content creation tool. All projects will be expected to use Unreal and target these platforms.

Due to this tight and narrow focus, this program is NOT the best choice for students most interested in traditional "AAA" console development (if this is your main interest, consider programs like DigiPen, Guildhall at SMU, SCAD, and USC), or in creating experimental "indie" games and/or working at the intersections of games and art (for this focus, consider UCLA, Parsons, and the NYU Game Center). 

The program aims to prepare students for careers as mechanics / systems designers, UX / interaction designers, game level designers, project managers, producers, or - for those coming into the program with substantial programming experience - mobile VR/AR game/app programmers. We strongly encourage you to research what those roles actually entail on a day-to-day basis to see which ones, if any, strongly appeal to you. Reach out to us with any questions you might have about them - and make sure to do this research before enrolling! You really don't want to spend two years of hard work preparing for a job you don't actually want to do.

The program does NOT aim to prepare students for work in traditional console / PC "AAA" game development, and is also not the best choice for those looking to 

The LIU Game and App Design and Development MFA program 

The LIU Game and App Design and Development MFA program (LIU gaMeFA for short) is a full-time, two-year, 48-credit cohort-based studio graduate program More specifically, the program focuses on game and app design and development for mobile VR and AR platforms like Samsung Gear VR and the forthcoming Magic Leap, using the popular and powerful Unreal Engine. 

Let's go through what that means in more detail, piece by piece.



"COHORT-BASED"
Everyone coming into the program in each year takes the same classes together for the full two year duration of the program *. This set curriculum consists of three four-semester course sequences:

- A sequence focused on developing technical expertise with Unreal Engine and other industry-standard content production/editing/management tools, and on developing a constructive and respected online presence in those tools' online communities.

- A sequence focused on developing broad game and app literacy, and on analyzing and understanding the design and business considerations - UX best practices, monetization models, and more - specific to mobile VR and AR platforms.

* with a small number of exceptions for electives after the first semester

"FULL-TIME"
Though scheduled class time is limited to about 12 hours a week, all classes take place during weekday daytime hours, and an additional 6 hour weekday daytime block is set aside for team-based project work. Students will also need to devote 15-20+ additional hours a week to homework to get full value out of the curriculum and ensure they are employable upon graduation. 

Because of this, and because taking full advantage of the vital extracurricular educational and networking opportunities that studying in New York provides also means making time every week to prepare for and attend events, meetups, festivals, and/or exhibits, we discourage you in the strongest terms from working full-time or undertaking other comparable non-academic time commitments while enrolled in the program.

We appreciate that working full-time may feel like the only or most practical way to eat and pay rent while studying, but, put simply, you will not have sufficient study time to get your tuition money's worth if you do so. You will be better off in the long run, financially and professionally, if you restrict yourself to working part-time and take out more in loans to cover the difference. 

For our part, we will help you look for and apply for additional sources of funding, and will happily share all our insider experience with making ends meet in New York on a tight budget. 

"TWO-YEAR"
You must start your studies in the fall and finish the program in a single continuous fall-spring, fall-spring four-semester sequence, together with the rest of your entering cohort. We will do our utmost to help you make the necessary timely progress, but there will be no exceptions to this requirement.

The fall semester runs from September to December, and the spring semester from January to May. Though there will be no classes in the summer between the first and second year, that time is not intended to be a vacation; students will be expected to spend it working on their thesis projects and/or completing an internship. 

We will help you structure that time so that you make progress on your thesis, and/or help you find, land, and make the most of relevant, paid internships.
